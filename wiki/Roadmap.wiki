describes the roadmap of ZaZENgine

Development should happen under the motto: „First make it work, then make it look good and then make it work fast“. Don't waste too much time in small details, try to get a correct result as fast as possible, then make it beautiful both in code and visual appearance. Bevore the renderer is not finished, no big optimizations should happen.

ALWAYS: find a good game-idea
* full 3D with beautiful materials and lighting, no iso&2d
*playing, creating, experiencing, fascinating (PCEF)
*should behave like a simulation, independent from the player
*player can change the simulation by invoking actions
*no destruction & hard working in the game (e.g. shooter )
*music: ambient, so game must fit into this kind of music

Finish Renderer
*material-system
*deferred shadow-maping
*multi-lights

Overhaul Architecture
*split into separate libs - clean separation into header files needed
*loading of libs/modules at runtime

Implement Scripting-Mechanism
*depends on the kind of game

Implement Sound
*expand usage of fmod
*sound-events

Implement AI
*use existing open-source ai
*use existing open-source pathfinding

Implement Networking
*use existing networking lib
