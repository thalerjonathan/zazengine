/* Can be used as the view-point of a camera or light
 *
 * in opengl the camera is always in the 0/0/0 origin and points down
 * the -Z achsis. the camera itself is not modified but instead one has
 * to apply the inverse operation on the viewing matrix to achive a
 * camera/viewer transformation
 *
 * IMPLEMENTED: it is nice to use only modelMatrix for the orientation-manipulation
 * and derive viewMatrix as the inverse of the modelMatrix.
 * The pro of this approach is, that we can easily switch between modeling an object in world-space and
 * switch to its point-of-view. this becomes very important for lights because they need to be
 * placed within the scene with modeling-transformations to which camera-viewing must be applied
 * but it must also be able to render the scene from the point-of-view of the light for shadowmap rendering.
