Replace all If-Then in shaders with subroutines if possible
	-> lighting-shadowing also possible to replace by subroutines instead of complete shader-switch

Explore Bindless G-Buffer
	-> more cleaner solution
	-> can be extended more easily
	-> faster
	-> order indipendent transparency (OIT) in deferred rendering!!!

Materials after new g-buffer rendering-system
	-> microfacet
	-> anisotrophic material
	-> cook-torrance

Msaa
	-> do sampling in geometry fragment-shader (centroid)
	-> dual source blending?
	
Water-Rendering
	-> waves
		-> tesselation
		-> geometry-shader
	-> fresnel
	-> refraction
	-> reflections

Post-Processing in Screen-Space
	-> HDR
	-> Bloom
	-> Tone-Mapping
	-> Depth Of Field

Particle System
	-> techniques
		-> transform-feedback rendering
		-> compute-shaders ?
		-> tesselation-shaders ?
		-> geometry-shaders ?
	-> gravity
	-> global physically simulated
		-> bounce off other geometry
	-> local physically simulated
		-> no bouncing off other geometry
	-> poing-lights
		-> glowing huge number of point-light particles illuminate dark scene
			-> no shadow-casting
	-> no poing-lights
		-> don't illuminate scene
	
Text-rendering
	-> use OGLFT

Lighting
	-> make z-bias configurable/light - directional lights need a higher bias
	-> make filter-width of PCF configurable and filtering on/off possible
	-> add projective textures for the lightsources
		-> cube-map is invariant => vertex must be transformed to view-space and then lookup vector calcualted

Need generic effect/material functionality
	-> no need to set input or output indices in shaders, can be done with layout ( location = ... )
		-> remove glGetFragDataLocation, glBindFragDataLocation, glGetAttribLocation, glBindAttribLocation
		-> remove glUniform1i and glUniformBlockBinding
	-> on top of program- & shader-management
		-> implement #include in shaders: parse loaded string and replace
			-> GL_ARB_shading_language_include is an extension that provides an #include directive to GLSL
		-> problem: compiler error generate other line numbers!
	-> use shaders-subroutines
		-> compile all possible material stuff in the shader and select by setting propriate subroutine
			-> needs includes
	-> based upon effect-files like directx/cg shader effects
	-> need some semantics on uniforms
	-> custom shader program for material programming
	-> problem: shaders-effect architecture from 2003 is based upon forward-rendering, we need now to plug it into deferred rendering
		-> 2 stages: geometry & ligting => potential up to 4 shaders/material: vertex&fragment in geometry & lighting
			-> BUT: vertex in geometry- & lighting-stage is very hard wired to deferred rendering
	-> important FIRST finish all special algorithms: shadow mapping, normal mapping, transparency, lighting, reflections, MSAA, ... (?)
	-> can be seen as a generic framework to implement BRDFs (?)
		-> sub-surface-scattering
		-> cook torrance sparrow
		-> subsurface scattering
		-> microfacet

Reflections
	-> environment (cube-mapping)
		-> need very generic renderFrame-method which allows to be called recursively
			-> need for every recursion level one CubeMap-FBO
			-> need to generify much of the code of the renderer-loop
			-> pass in some render-Context struct 
				-> holds recursion-level
				-> holds render-target where to render or null when to default framebuffer
				-> holds flag if shadow-rendering in environment-rendering
				-> holds flag if transparency-rendering in environment-rendering
				-> holds flag if interreflection-rendering in environment-rendering
				-> holds max recursion depth
		-> can be done directly with deferred renderning, no need for fallback to forward-rendering
			-> but need additional environment-rendering fbo
				-> render 6 faces of a cubemap, each with deferred rendering => fucking huge impact on bandwith and performance
					-> dramatic reduced resolution of cube-map sides e.g. 512x512
		-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9841863/reflection-refraction-with-chromatic-aberration-eye-correction
		-> use geometry-shader to render to cube-map layers ?
		-> can to do refraction & reflection
		-> simulate chromatic abberration (see Orange Book)
			-> need to simulate different wavelengths for red, green and blue channels
		-> different texture-binding because material could or could not use binding points
			-> general texture binding-point management
				-> giving next free n slots
				-> call to bind of texture, will return binding-point or -1 if fails
				-> but need to release texture to keep track of usage
				-> keep track for all texture-types (2d & cube so far)
					-> every binding-point can have each type active
				-> keep track of max_texture_units
		-> more flexible renderInstances: need finer control over which materials to draw
		-> new material-type:
			<material name="Glass">
				<type id="ENVIRONMENTAL">
				  <reflection>
					... params
				  </reflection>

				  <refraction>
					... params
				  </refraction>
      
				  <diffuseColor file="cross_diffuse.jpg"/>
				  <color r="0.54" g="0.89" b="0.63"/>
				</type>
			  </material>
		-> material subclasses
			-> environment holds cube-map and params for shaders. it knows how often update cube-map per second
	-> planar
		-> render mirror-plane as usual with stencil enabled
		-> render world mirrored by this plane as usual
			-> stencil will remove all pixels not affected by this plane
			-> use according blending-function to create mirror-effect

Transparency-Rendering (see GPU Gems 2 Page 295)
	-> Differentiate between normal transparency and refractive transparency
		-> normal transparency can be rendered at the very last using normal opengl blending
			-> no overhead of copying depth, reading background and combining results into new background
		-> split into two types: TRANSPARENT_BLENDING & TRANSPARENT_REFRACTION
	
	-> Do Colored Shadow-Rendering for Transparent objects
		-> render transparent object in shadow-map generation AND write color of transparent object to additional color-texture in shadow-fbo
			-> optimization: when material is transparent write to 1.0 to alpha-channel, else 0.0
			=> need additional render-target in shadow-fbo: shadow-color target
		-> during light-rendering: when fragment in shadow do an additional lookup into the shadow-color texture to get the shadow-color for this fragment
			-> optimization: only do additional lookup when alpha-channel is 1.0
		-> for better quality: do multisampling texture lookups

GLFW Context
	-> Allow Toggle fullscreen
		-> reinit window & render-context!
			=> need to reinig glew, programs, textures,... (?)
			=> lot of work to do, because everything needs to be re-init-able
		-> for this to work we need to split creation of objects which interact with opengl and the initialization of those object with opengl-state
			-> initialization must happen in a specific order. faster buffers need to be created first,... 

Optimization WHEN RENDERER HAS FINISHED, NOT BEFORE!!!
	-> instanced rendering
	-> texture-compression
	-> use copies of uniform buffers e.g. for each light a buffer
		-> this reduces the update just to binding the buffer ot the shader and not uploading values to fields every frame
		-> No more bindbufferbase of uniformblocks in renderer - do it after programs are linked in uniformmanagement
	-> Calculate position in Fragment-Shader
		-> http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Compute_eye_space_from_window_space
		-> use screen-coordinates & depth instead of spending a whole buffer on it
		-> compare Performance!!
		From Object-Coordinates to Viewport-Coordinates
		1. Input of object coordinates  aka object-space
				modeling transform
		2. world-coordinates aka world-space
				viewing transform
		3. view-coordinates ( aka eye-coordinates or eye-space)
				projection transform
		4. clip-coordinates ( aka clip-space ): all in range of -/+ clip-volume
				perspective division
		5. normaliced device coordinates ( NDC ): all in range from -1 to +1 (center is 0/0/0 )
				view-port transform
		6. viewport coordinates: all in range from 0/0 to resolutionX/resolutionY of viewport
		7. fragment-shader operates on viewport coordinates
		From Viewport- to View-Space Coordinates
		1. Input of Viewport-Coordinates AND depth in NDC-space for each fragment
				transform x & y to NDC: 
					- divide by resolutionX/resolutionY => range from 0 to 1
					- transform x by: x * 2 - 1 => in range from -1 to 1
					- transform y by: ( 1 - y ) * 2 - 1 => in range from -1 to 1: need to take care of the origin! it makes a difference wheter its in the left UPPER or left LOWER corner
		2. NDC
				add depth to x & y-vector because now all in same space
		3. clip-coordinates
				apply inverse projection transformation to position
				divide by w to transform back to homogenous coordinates
				( in perspective projection the perspective division by w is done => the inverse would be multiplication 
					but we apply the inverse projection transform => need again to divide )
		4. view-coordinates
	-> Lighting
		-> use stencil buffer to reduce lighting to geometry only
			-> use only for point- & spotlight because directional light will affect sky-box and ambient too
		->  bounding geometry for light
			-> point-light: sphere with radius 1 and then scale according to light distance & some epsilon
				-> low-poly count
			-> spot-light: ?
			-> Solve Problem of Ambient + Sky-Box Lighting
				-> when no directional light in scene
					-> render full-screen quad and apply ambient-term to non-sky-box material and diffuse-only to sky-box material => need new program
					-> other lights accumulate by blending
				-> when directional light in scene
					-> include ambient-term in non-sky-box material and diffuse-only to sky-box material 
	-> Culling
		-> View-space culling using camera
		-> implement CHC++
	-> create most important render-targets (g-buffer) & depth-buffers (G-buffer, shadow-maps,...) first
	-> DO IN-DEPTH PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENTS (premature optimiziation is the root of all evil!)
		-> use nvidia nsight
	-> use EXT_direct_state_access
		-> no more need to bind textures, ...

	-> Do Culling
		-> View-Frustum
		-> Occlusion Culling using queries (like CHC++) 
		-> Culling library (Umbra 3) ?
	-> pre multiply matrices in CPU instead of doing in shaders
	-> reduce branching in shaders (need different shader-architecture, see below)
	-> check if all glClear-commands are necessary
		-> g-buffer color-targets will be overwritten anyway
		-> use invalidate on FBO, check if this will improve performance
	-> Experiment with different render-target formats for performance
	-> really all calls necessary e.g. always bindBuffer, ... ? are some states stored in buffers?
	-> render SKYBOX AFTER other geometry and utilize stencil-buffer to mask fragments occluding the sky-box
	-> opengl 4.3 allows for READ & WRITE of textures (images) at the same time
		-> use for rendering transparent-glass
	-> do depth-sorting for ALL objects in scene
		-> calculate model-view once and then reuse in geometry-rendering
	-> no need to do depth copy during transparent-glass rendering: WARNING DO IN-DEPTH PROFILING!
		-> render transparent object without write do depth
			-> can bind g-buffer depth as texture
		-> then when object was not last one, render it again but only depth
	-> non-overlapping transparent objects can be drawn in same batch => reduce copy and combine-overhead
		-> transform bbMin, bbMax and center of all transp. instances to view-coordinates by multiplying with MV-Matrix of viewer
		-> calculate AABB: aabbMinX = min( bbMin.x, bbMax.x ), aabbMaxX = max( bbMin.x, bbMax.x ), aabbMinY = max( bbMin.y, bbMax.y ), aabbMaxY = max( bbMin.y, bbMax.y )
		-> calculate overlapping for all transp. instances using the AABB
			-> for each instance create a list which contains the overlapping instances
		-> all instances with empty list go direct to batch-level 0 because they don't overlap with any other instance
		-> all instances with non-empty list need further investigation
		
Switch all to OpenGL 4.3 with new System (NVidia!)
	-> extension ARB_program_interface_query
