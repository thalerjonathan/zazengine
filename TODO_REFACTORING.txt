Code-Quality
	- put magic ids & numbers into constants: uniform-names, uniformblock-names, uniformblock-field names
	- const-completeness (add const to inline methods were appropriate)
	- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
	- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
	- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities
	- project buildable as RELEASE
	- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
	- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
	- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound (same as e.g. textures in graphics)
	- UNIT-Tests?
	
Port To Linux & do parallel development
	-> use newest openSuse
	-> eclipse CDT as IDE
	-> use nouvou drivers
		-> compile them with debug mode available
			-> allows to step into driver-calls which should be VERY interesting
	-> compile as x86 x64?
	-> Software & Tools
		-> gDEBugger
		-> blender
		-> audacity
		-> open asset import library
	-> check if all libs are available
		-> Boost: 		YES
		-> OIS: 			YES
		-> lua:				YES
		-> luabind:		YES
		-> assimp:		YES
		-> glew:			YES
		-> devil:			YES
		-> fmod:			YES
		-> log4cp:		YES
		-> ode:				YES
