Code-Quality
	- put magic ids & numbers into constants: uniform-names, uniformblock-names, uniformblock-field names
	- const-completeness (add const to inline methods were appropriate)
	- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
	- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
	- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
	- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound (same as e.g. textures in graphics)
	- UNIT-Tests?
