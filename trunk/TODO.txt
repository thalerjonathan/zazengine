!!! FROM NOW ON: always compileable & runnable when checked in !!!

For Qualcomm presentation (implementation deadline saturday)
- transform lighting position to MV
- fix sky-box (correct up/down/south/north)
- crash when loading .obj models
- ply models not showing?


For myself
Graphics:

- graphics: shadow - mapping solve it!
- normal-mapping

Advanced
- make physics processing async

Code-Quality
- encapsulate MRTs in own texture-like class
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- add const to inline methods were appropriate
- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound
- UNIT-Tests?

Hacks
- fmod should be initialized as 3D_RIGHTHANDED
- ode now y-axis as z-achsis because of 3ds models
