Refactoring, Fixing & Clean-Up
- caching of uniform-locations in program: only need for one lookup!
- glViewport-call clenaup
- fix mrt-visualisation
- reduce OpenGL-Calls
	-> check if all unbinds are really necessary
- remove ALL legacy calls: create hard-coded vertex-arrays for sky-box, full-screen quad & mrt-visualiation (see geom-type renderBB() )

- render shadow-map: clearing of FBO not necessary this way & move drawNone after init
- do shadow-map generation of light during lighting-pass of each light
- split lighting-pass into "ambient&sky-box pass" & lighting-pass for each light => no lighting/shadowing of sky-box & objects visible also when no light in scene present
- use stencil buffer to mask skybox from lighting&shading
- check if any light casting shadows is in light-list, otherwise shadow-mapping would fail!

- shadowing of sky-box not wanted

- split methods in renderer in submethods, they are too long
- const-completeness (add const to inline methods were appropriate)
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities


Basic Graphics
- shadow-mapping
	-> correct lighting&shadowing equations: falloff, cone, ...
	-> do some sampling on shadow-edges
- normal-mapping
- other brdfs
- text-rendering
- multiple lights
	-> point-light boundary
	-> spot-light boundary
	-> directional full screen quad
	-> blending 
- remove ALL legacy-calls (use gDEBugger for help)
- msaa
	-> do sampling in geometry fragment-shader (centroid)
- optimization
	-> OpenGL-calls
	-> shaders
	-> initializations of shader
	-> use layout in shaders
	-> state-changes
- Fix View-Frustum culling


Advanced Graphics
- transparency
- reflections
- brdfs
	-> cook torrance sparrow
	-> subsurface scattering
	-> microfacet
- culling library (Umbra 3)

Game-Functionality
- allow mutliple scenes which can be changed during runtime. also specify which subsystems are necessary: load/unload them during runtime

Scenes
- brdf & model gallery
	-> famous models with all different brdfs placed in scene like in a gallery
	-> advanced brdfs
	-> shadowing
	-> lighting
	-> find some interesting "skybox" or surrounding model: http://www.3dmodelfree.com/

	Famous models (Stanford http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/ & Utah Teapot)
	-> teapot
	-> bunny
	-> dragon
	-> happy buddah
	-> armadillo
	-> lucy
	-> Asian Dragon
	-> Thai Statue

- qualcomm presentation
- chess
	-> show the chess-board 
	-> different material for black & white
	-> board reflects
	-> white transparent
	-> black subsurface scattering brdf
- rotating hyperdrive
	-> point light in center
	-> interesting shadow situation
- physics
	-> mesh
	-> spheres
	-> oder models fall down
	
Multithreading
- make physics processing async

Scripting
- TODO

Code-Quality
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound (same as e.g. textures in graphics)
- UNIT-Tests?
