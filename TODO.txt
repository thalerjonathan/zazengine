!!! FROM NOW ON: always compileable & runnable when checked in !!!

For Qualcomm presentation (implementation deadline saturday)
- graphics: make combination of deferred renderer work
- graphics: shadow - mapping

- split initialize-methods of subsystems in submethods: they are all too long
- add const to inline methods were appropriate
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- compile without warnings
- subsystem-constructor which gets passed in: id, type & core-instance
- cleanup code in ois & graphics
- cleanup header-includes

Graphics:
- add transformations to models when loaded!

Advanced
- make physics processing async

Code-Quality
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound
- UNIT-Tests?

Hacks
- fmod should be initialized as 3D_RIGHTHANDED
- ode now y-axis as z-achsis because of 3ds models
