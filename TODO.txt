!!! FROM NOW ON: always compileable & runnable when checked in !!!

For Qualcomm presentation (implementation deadline saturday)
Graphics
- texture-mapping
- normal-mapping
- phong-illumination
- ambient lighting
- skyp-box?

Bugfixing:
soundplayback

Code-Quality
- format all header-files same (see Zazengraphcis)
- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
- cleanup header-includes
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- compile without warnings
- add const to inline methods were appropriate
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities


For myself
Graphics:
- add transformations to models when loaded!
- graphics: shadow - mapping solve it!

Advanced
- make physics processing async

Code-Quality
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound
- UNIT-Tests?

Hacks
- fmod should be initialized as 3D_RIGHTHANDED
- ode now y-axis as z-achsis because of 3ds models
