!!! FROM NOW ON: always compileable & runnable when checked in !!!

For Qualcomm presentation (implementation deadline saturday)
- physics: sphere is bouncing

- custom game-objects: generate spheres dropping above the floor
- custom game-objects: when sphere hits the floor: audio-output

- graphics: deferred renderer combined: F12 toggles between MRTs and combined deferred rendering
- bonus: toggle fullscreen

Advanced
- make physics processing async

Code-Quality
- compile without warnings
- project buildable as RELEASE
- remove paths in access to files in code, only file-name access anymore, paths configurable
- subsystem-constructor which gets passed in: id, type & core-instance
- cleanup code in ois & graphics
- move pipeline-shaders required for deferred renderer from zazensquares to zazengine. pipeline is then copied to bin of squares: pipeline/graphics, pipeline/audio,...
- move config of subsystems of zazengine from zazensquares to zazengine. config is then copied to bin of squares: config/graphics, config/audio,...
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- UNIT-Tests?

Game-Object creation and Level-Loading/Level-Creation
- think of a practical solution how to inject gameobjects and game-logic into the engine from squares
- ifaces: creation of gameentities in subsystem through api, not only through xml ?
