!!! FROM NOW ON: always compileable & runnable when checked in !!!

- subsystems no more typed by string, but fixed by dynamic-type => expose each subsystem through ICore e.g. getGraphics, getPhysics,... instead of getSubsystemByType
- subsystem-constructor which gets passed in: id, type & core-instance
- make OIS run (depends on DirectInput8 unfortunately :( )
- include audio

- fix problem with assetimporter
- transform data from assetimporter to geomtype
- compile without warnings
- project buildable as RELEASE
- find out how to handle double-init of SDL in graphics & input (need SDL_PumpEvents in each loop & need init always? or works only with window?)
- move pipeline-shaders required for deferred renderer from zazensquares to zazengine. pipeline is then copied to bin of squares
- move config of subsystems of zazengine from zazensquares to zazengine. config is then copied to bin of squares
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- think of a practical solution how to inject gameobjects and game-logic into the engine from squares 
- ifaces: creation of gameentities in subsystem through api, not only through xml ?
- make physics processing async
