Graphics
- loading of .obj & .ply
- transform lighting position to MV
- shadow-mapping
- normal-mapping
- multiple lights
- msaa
- optimization
- culling library (Umbra 3)
- remove ALL legacy-calls (use gDEBugger for help)

Multithreading
- make physics processing async

Scripting
- TODO

Code-Quality
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- add const to inline methods were appropriate
- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound (same as e.g. textures in graphics)
- UNIT-Tests?
