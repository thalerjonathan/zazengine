Basic Graphics
- visualisation of bounding-boxes possible (wireframe or vertices)
- chess-game possible: set material for each geom-type
- phong-illumination
	-> fix lighting-space calculations
	-> revise diffuse color calc
	-> add global ambient term
	-> add emissive term
	-> add specular term
	-> add specular power
- shadow-mapping
- normal-mapping
- multiple lights
	-> point-light boundary
	-> spot-light boundary
	-> directional full screen quad
	-> blending 
- remove ALL legacy-calls (use gDEBugger for help)
- msaa
	-> do sampling in geometry fragment-shader (centroid)
- optimization
	-> OpenGL-calls
	-> shaders
	-> initializations of shader
	-> use layout in shaders
	-> state-changes
- Fix View-Frustum culling


Advanced Graphics
- transparency
- reflections
- brdfs
	-> cook torrance sparrow
	-> subsurface scattering
	-> microfacet
- culling library (Umbra 3)
- scene: rotation of 3 hierarchical donuts with point-light in center casting shadow

Multithreading
- make physics processing async

Scripting
- TODO

Code-Quality
- replace all strcmp with boost:iequals
- add const to inline methods were appropriate
- keep id, type & core in ISubSystem as readable
- remove friend-initialisation bullshit from entities
- project buildable as RELEASE
- check if everything is cleaned up when a subsystem cannot be initialized
- A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF INCLUDING TINY-XML IN ALL SUBSYSTEMS
- fmod-subsystem should do a proper loading and managing of its loaded sound (same as e.g. textures in graphics)
- UNIT-Tests?
