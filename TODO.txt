Scenes

Selection Menu
	For the sake of usability and easy selection there is the need of a selection menu to select.
	Shows the ability of the game-engine to load/unload scenes and features and a scripted menu-system.

Monsters Ball - Animations, physical particles & scripting
	-> doom3 models roaming around
	-> imp firing fireball
	-> hellknight walks
	-> particle-mist is moved by models when walking through it
	-> shadowing & lighting

Model gallery - Material-system, shadow & lighting
	-> camera steearble
	-> famous models with all different brdfs placed in scene like in a gallery
	-> advanced brdfs
	-> shadowing
	-> lighting
	-> find some interesting "skybox" or surrounding model: http://www.3dmodelfree.com/

	Famous models (Stanford http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/ & Utah Teapot)
	-> teapot
	-> bunny
	-> dragon
	-> happy buddah
	-> armadillo
	-> lucy
	-> Asian Dragon
	-> Thai Statue

Chess - transparency rendering, scripting
	Replays a famous 'immortal' chess game where the pieces move around by themselves. Different materials for black & white where white is transparent and black has subsurface scattering. Board is reflective.
	Shows off the scripting-strengths, very advanced material BRDFs (subsurface scattering & transparency) and planar reflections.
	-> pieces move around by themselves
	-> fixed rotating camera
	-> show the chess-board 
	-> different material for black & white
	-> board reflects
	-> white transparent
	-> black subsurface scattering brdf
	-> instanced rendering of pawns
	
Seaside - water rendering
	Shows a nice auto-generated island surrounded by the ocean. Sun follows a fast-forward 24 hour cycle from dusk till dawn.
	Shows off the strength of the game-engine to render tesselated water with refractions and reflections using FFT together with a high dynamic range lighting scenario.
	-> reflective
	-> refractive
	-> fourier-transformated waves
	-> planar reflections
	-> refractions
	-> tesselation
	-> directional lighting 
	-> sun: from dusk till dawn: lighting situations!

zusätzliche szene: 
	-> viele gleiche meshes -> instanced rendering und viele lichtquellen -> light bounding meshes.
